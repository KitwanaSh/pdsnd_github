###Bike Share Project
This is a data science **project** created to analyze how users rent bicycle on a very short-term basis for a price.
This allows people to borrow a bike from one point and return it to another point, though they can also return it to the same location if theyâ€™d like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
